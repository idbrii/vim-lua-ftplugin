This is a **stripped-down version** of vim-lua for use with
[LuaLS](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) or other [LSP
servers](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). It excludes
completion, syntax checking, and other redundant features. I wanted to simplify
my lua setup to reduce any potential sources of errors. See the [deluxe
branch](https://github.com/idbrii/vim-lua-ftplugin/tree/deluxe) or [Peter
Odding's original lua ftplugin](http://peterodding.com/code/vim/lua-ftplugin)
for a version that includes more features (most are toggleable).


# Lua file type plug-in for the Vim text editor

The [Lua][lua] file type plug-in for [Vim][vim] makes it easier to work with Lua source code in Vim by providing the following features:

 * The ['includeexpr'][inex] option is set so that the [gf][gf] (go to file) mapping knows how to resolve Lua module names using [package.path][pp]

 * The ['include'][inc] option is set so that Vim follows [dofile()][dof], [loadfile()][lof] and [require()][req] calls when looking for identifiers in included files (this works together with the ['includeexpr'][inex] option)

 * `K` (normal mode) and `<F1>` (insert mode) on a Lua function or 'method' call will try to open the relevant documentation in the [Lua Reference for Vim][lrv]

 * Several [text-objects][tob] are defined so you can jump between blocks and functions

 * A pretty nifty hack of the [matchit plug-in][mit] is included: When the cursor is on a `function` or `return` keyword the `%` mapping cycles between the relevant keywords (`function`, `return`, `end`), this also works for branching statements (`if`, `elseif`, `else`, `end`) and looping statements (`for`, `while`, `repeat`, `until`, `end`)

## Installation

*Please note that the vim-lua-ftplugin plug-in requires the xolox/vim-misc plug-in which is separately distributed.*

Unzip the most recent ZIP archives of the [vim-lua-ftplugin] [download-lua-ftplugin] and [vim-misc] [download-misc] plug-ins inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is `~/.vim` on UNIX and `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` (use `:helptags ~\vimfiles\doc` instead on Windows).

If you prefer you can also use [Pathogen] [pathogen], [Vundle] [vundle] or a similar tool to install & update the [vim-lua-ftplugin] [github-lua-ftplugin] and [vim-misc] [github-misc] plug-ins using a local clone of the git repository.

Now try it out: Edit a Lua script and try any of the features documented above.

## Options

The Lua file type plug-in handles options as follows: First it looks at buffer local variables, then it looks at global variables and if neither exists a default is chosen. This means you can change how the plug-in works for individual buffers. For example to change the location of the Lua compiler used to check the syntax:

    " This sets the default value for all buffers.
    :let g:lua_interpreter_path = '/usr/local/bin/lua'

    " This is how you change the value for one buffer.
    :let b:lua_interpreter_path = '/usr/local/bin/lua52'

### The `lua_interpreter_path` option

The name or path of the Lua interpreter used to evaluate Lua scripts used by the plug-in (for example the script that checks for undefined global variables, see `:LuaCheckGlobals`).

### The `lua_internal` option

If you're running a version of Vim that supports the Lua Interface for Vim (see [if_lua.txt][if_lua.txt]) then all Lua code evaluated by the Lua file type plug-in is evaluated using the Lua Interface for Vim. If the Lua Interface for Vim is not available the plug-in falls back to using an external Lua interpreter. You can set this to false (0) to force the plug-in to use an external Lua interpreter.
